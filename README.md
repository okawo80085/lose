# lose

lose, but in particular `lose.LOSE()`, is a helper class for handling data using `hdf5` file format and `PyTables`

```python
>>> from lose import LOSE
>>> l = LOSE()
>>> l
<lose hdf5 data handler, fname=None, atom=Float32Atom(shape=(), dflt=0.0)>
generator parameters: iterItems=None, iterOutput=None, batch_size=1, limit=None, loopforever=False, shuffle=False
```

## installation
```python
pip3 install -U lose
```
or
```python
pip install -U lose
```

## structure
#### vars
`LOSE.fname` is the path to the `.h5` file including the name and extension, default is `None`.

`LOSE.atom` recommended to be left at default, is the `dtype` for the data to be stored in, default is `tables.Float32Atom()` which results to arrays with `dtype==np.float32`.

**`LOSE.generator()` related vars:**

`LOSE.batch_size` batch size of data getting pulled from the `.h5` file, default is `1`.

`LOSE.limit` limits the amount of data loaded by the generator, default is `None`, if `None` all available data will be loaded. 

`LOSE.loopforever` bool that allows infinite looping over the data, default is `False`.

`LOSE.iterItems` list of X group names and list of Y group names, default is `None`, required to be user defined for `LOSE.generator()` to work.

`LOSE.iterOutput` list of X output names and list of Y output names for `LOSE.iterItems` to be mapped to, default is `None`, required to be user defined for `LOSE.generator()` to work.

`LOSE.shuffle` bool that enables shuffling of the data, default is `False`, shuffling is affected by `LOSE.limit` and `LOSE.batch_size`.

 ```

`LOSE.newGroup(fmode='a', **groupNames)` is used to append/write(depends on the `fmode` keyword argument, default is `'a'`) group(s) to a `.h5` file.


`LOSE.removeGroup(*groupNames)` is used for to remove group(s) from a file, provided the group(s) name.


`LOSE.renameGroup(**groupNames)` is used to rename group(s) within a `.h5` file, see examples below.


`LOSE.save(**groupNamesAndSahpes)` is used to save data(in append mode only) to a group(s) into a `.h5` file, the data needs to have the same shape as `group.shape[1:]` the data was passed to, `LOSE.get_shape(groupName)` can be used to get the `group.shape`.


`LOSE.load(*groupNames)` is used to load data(hole group or a slice, to load a slice change `LOSE.batch_obj` to a string with the desired slice, default is `"[:]"`) from a group, group has to be present in the `.h5` file.


`LOSE.getShape(groupName)` is used to get the shape of a single group, group has to be present in the `.h5` file.


`LOSE.generator()` check `LOSE.generator() details` section, `LOSE.iterItems` and `LOSE.iterOutput` have to be defined.


`LOSE.makeGenerator(layerNames, limit=None, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, **data)` again check `LOSE.generator() details` more details.

## example usage

##### creating/adding new group(s) to a file
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE()
l.fname = 'path/to/your/save/file.h5' # path to the .h5 file, has to be user defined before any methods can be used, default is None

exampleDataX = np.arange(20, dtype=np.float32)
exampleDataY = np.arange(3, dtype=np.float32)

l.newGroup(fmode='w', x=(0, *exampleDataX.shape), y=(0, *exampleDataY.shape)) # creating new groups(ready for data saved to) in a file, if fmode is 'w' all groups in the file will be overwritten
```
##### saving data to a group(s)
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE()
l.fname = 'path/to/your/save/file.h5' # path to the .h5 file, has to be user defined before any methods can be used, default is None

exampleDataX = np.arange(20, dtype=np.float32)
exampleDataY = np.arange(3, dtype=np.float32)

l.save(x=[exampleDataX, exampleDataX], y=[exampleDataY, exampleDataY]) # saving data into groups defined in the previous example
l.save(y=[exampleDataY], x=[exampleDataX]) # the same thing
```
##### loading data from a group(s) within a file
for this example file has data from the previous example
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE()
l.fname = 'path/to/your/save/file.h5' # path to the .h5 file, has to be user defined before any methods can be used, default is None

x, y = l.load('x', 'y') # loading data from the .h5 file(has to be a real file) populated by previous examples
y2compare, x2compare = l.load('y', 'x') # the same thing

print (np.all(x == x2compare), np.all(y == y2compare)) # True True
```
##### getting the shape of a group
for this example file has data from previous examples
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE()
l.fname = 'path/to/your/save/file.h5' # path to the .h5 file(populated by previous examples), has to be user defined before any methods can be used, default is None

print (l.getShape('x')) # (3, 20)
print (l.getShape('y')) # (3, 3)
```
##### renaming group(s) in a file
for this example file has data from previous examples
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE('path/to/your/save/file.h5')
x2compare, y2compare = l.load('x', 'y')
print (l) # file structure before renaming any group(s)
l.renameGroup(y='z', x='lol')
lol, z = l.load('lol', 'z')
print (l) # file structure after renaming group(s)
print (np.all(x2compare == lol), np.all(y2compare == z)) # True True
```
##### removing group(s) from a file
for this example file has data from previous examples
```python
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE(fname='path/to/your/save/file.h5')

l.removeGroup('lol', 'z') # removing the group(s)

x = l.load('lol') # now this will result in an error because group 'x' was removed from the file
```
## `LOSE.generator()` details
`LOSE.generator()` is a python generator used to access data from a `hdf5` file in `LOSE.batch_size` pieces without loading the hole file/group into memory, also works with `tf.keras.model.fit_generator()`, __have__ to be used with a `with` context statement(see examples below).


`LOSE.iterItems` and `LOSE.iterOutput` __have__ to be defined by user first.


`LOSE.make_generator(layerNames, limit=None, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, **data)` has the same rules as `LOSE.generator()`. however the data needs to be passed to it each time it's initialized, data is only stored temporarily, the parameters are passed to it on initialization, `layerNames` acts like `LOSE.iterOutput` and `LOSE.iterItems`, but every name in it has to match to names of the data passed(see examples below), if file `temp.h5` exists it will be overwritten and then deleted.

### example `LOSE.generator()` usage
for this example lets say that file has requested data in it and the model input/output layer names are present.
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE(fname='path/to/your/file/with/data.h5')

l.iterItems = [['x1', 'x2'], ['y']] # names of X and Y groups, all group names need to have batch dim the same and be present in the .h5 file
l.iterOutput = [['input_1', 'input_2'], ['dense_5']] # names of model's layers the data will be cast on, group.shape[1:] needs to match the layer's input shape
l.loopforever = True
l.batch_size = 20 # some batch size, can be bigger then the dataset, but won't output more data, it will just loop over or stop the iteration if LOSE.loopforever is False

l.limit = 10000 # lets say that the file has more data, but you only want to train on first 10000 samples

l.shuffle = True # enable data shuffling for the generator, costs memory and time

with l.generator() as gen:
	some_model.fit_generator(gen(), steps_per_epoch=50, epochs=1000, shuffle=False) # model.fit_generator() still can't shuffle the data, but LOSE.generator() can
```

### example `LOSE.make_generator(layerNames, limit=None, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, **data)` usage
for this example lets say the model's input/output layer names are present and shapes match with the data.
```python
import numpy as np
from lose import LOSE

l = LOSE()

num_samples = 1000

x1 = np.zeros((num_samples, 200)) # example data for the model, x1.shape[1:] == model.get_layer('input_1').output_shape[1:]
x2 = np.zeros((num_samples, 150)) # example data for the model, x2.shape[1:] == model.get_layer('input_2').output_shape[1:]
y = np.zeros((num_samples, 800)) # example data for the model, y.shape[1:] == model.get_layer('dense_5').output_shape[1:]

with l.make_generator([['input_1', 'input_2'], ['dense_5']], batch_size=10, shuffle=True, input_2=x2, input_1=x1, dense_5=y) as gen:
	del x1 #remove from memory
	del x2 #remove from memory
	del y #remove from memory

	some_model.fit_generator(gen(), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10000, shuffle=False) # again data can't be shuffled by model.fit_generator(), shuffling should be done by the generator
```
